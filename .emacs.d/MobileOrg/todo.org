  - Doesn't need to have direct quotes, just has to reference things from the texts
  - Script:
    - Quote: =A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks that others throw at him.= -David Brinkley
    - Main idea: Each text supports this quote by showing how adversity can lead to success.
    - Chosen texts: Whatever It Takes and Shark Attack
    - Whatever it takes notes
      - The song is about how sacrificing led to being more successful
      - The bricks don't have to come from other people, they can come from yourself as well
      - "Whip, whip" and "break me down and build me up" 
    - Shark Attack
      - This is about a girl who lost her arm in a shark attack and experienced post traumatic growth
      - The brick was thrown by the shark in this instance
      - It showed how she became happier after the attack
      - The text talks about how the traumatic experience leads to her becoming a happier, more successful person overall
