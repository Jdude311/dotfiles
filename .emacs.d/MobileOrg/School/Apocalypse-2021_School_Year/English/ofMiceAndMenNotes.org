:END:
In Chapter Two of /Of Mice and Men/,Steinbeck uses the symbol of the color red to show how Curley's wife is a flirtatious, pretty person, but also a dangerous person to be around. The color red often symbolizes love and passion, but also danger: it has a dual purpose. Steinbeck writes, "She had full, rouged lips and wide-spaced eyes, heavily made up. Her fingernails were red" (Steinbeck). Through the inclusion of the color red, he emphasizes the idea that Curley's wife is a pretty woman. When he says, "full, rouged lips," it shows that she puts time and care into looking nice. It paints a picture of a woman in a red dress. However, the color red also symbolizes and emphasizes the danger of being around her. Red is a color of warning as well as of love, and Steinbeck describes her with the color red to reflect this. Because she's Curley's wife, anyone who does anything suggestive around her would most likely be in trouble with Curley. In this way, she is almost like the woman in the red dress from the Matrix: if she distracts you, you will be in danger. Therefore, Steinbeck uses the color red to show that Curley's wife is "purty" but also dangerous.
