* Notes
** Civil War
*** Leading up to the civil war
**** Popular sovereignty
***** Problem: nobody could figure out what to do about slave and free states
+ It was a heated debate
  - People were almost ready to go to war over it (lol)
+ Nobody could come up with a solution
  - Missouri Compromise is having problems
+ Debate was heating up
***** Solution: Popular Sovereignty
+ Allows the people of the territories to decide what to do about slavery
  - People would get to choose if their territory would allow slavery
  - Took the debate off the federal government
+ Had a lot of good things
  - Championed democracy
  - Took the heat of the government
  - Seems like a great idea
***** Problems with popular sovereignty
+ People couldn't figure out how to implement it
  - If you already owned slaves, could you keep them?
  - How would you vote?
    - What would you do about voter fraud?
    - Should it be direct or indirect voting?
+ It was a great way to avoid the problem, but didn't make it go away
  - Stephen Douglas discussed it a lot
    - As long as popular sovereignty was theoretical, he and the idea had supporters
  - People basically avoided working out the issues and actually implementing it
+ Nobody wanted to face the issues
  - Zachary Taylor completely ignores slavery in his campaign in 1848
    - Wins and becomes president
**** Clay, Calhoun, and Webster
***** They were all important senators
+ Never would become president, but had a huge impact
  - They were really really really good at compromising
    - Came up with important compromises about slavery
  - Kept the peace
***** Issues with slavery
+ California becomes the 31st state
  - Could become a free or slave state
  - The south doesn't want it to be free because it would give them an edge in the Senate
    - They also recognize it doesn't have that many slaves to start
    - The free states already have an edge in the house of reps, so this would mean free domination of congress
+ Texas was claiming land that's part of NM
  - If Texas gets the land, then there's more slavery land
    - North doesn't want that
  - South likes it
    - They like slavery
***** Clay, Calhoun, and Webster work together to compromise on Slavery
+ Clay sets up eight proposals
  - Hopes they would "muster with his colleagues" (not sure what that means?)
+ Calhoun says that the compromises would betray the south
  - Says that north needs to agree to protection of slavery
    - Says that for the south to feel comfortable staying in 'murica, they would have to
+ Webster says to accept Clay's proposals for the sake of the union
  - Pleads with North to accept South's demands
  - Says it's for the sake of the union
  - Withdraws support for Wilmot Proviso
  - Wanted to persuade enough Of his people to agree with Clay
**** The Compromise of 1850
+ Clay leaves for sickness, Stephen Douglas replaces him
  - Douglas tries to end the fight in his place
+ Zachary Taylor dies on July 9
  - He wasn't interested in compromise
  - His successor, Millard Fillmore, was
+ _Clay's compromise is passed in September_
***** Results of 1850 compromise
+ California is admitted to the Union
  - 16th free state
+ No federal restrictions on slavery in Utah or NM
  - Compromises for California being admitted to the Union
+ Texas loses boundary claims with NM
  - Compensated with $10 millon dollars
+ <<<Fugitive Slave Law>>> passed
  - Means that Northerners who find runaway slaves have to return them to their owners
+ _Overall, North gains the most_
  - They get the Senate and the House
