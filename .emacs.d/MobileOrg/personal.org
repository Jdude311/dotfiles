** 2020-01-04 Letter to future self                          :letter_to_self:
Dear Future Jaden,


I hope that you've been talking to Olivia. Stop fucking procrastinating dumbass, you want another friend or maybe even a girlfriend. Yes, I know that expecting you to have been texting people more regularly is wishful thinking and/or unrealistic, but like /get on it!/ Also, you have been FaceTiming your friends, right? Yeah, definitely not. Dumbass. Seriously, get on it. Meet with your friends in person too, stop not doing that.

Also, I really hope that things are going well with school and stuff. Your grades better be all in the nineties, especially Science Research and Chemistry.

Still using EMACS, I presume? I hope you haven't cluttered the config up again, I literally just finished cleaning it up. It took forever and I missed two entire lessons doing that, so please don't fuck it up. I also hope you cleaned up your polybar config. You have like 300 lines of unused shit. 

I'm almost willing to bet you completely forgot about this letter-writing thing. Please don't. I want to be able to read these. Don't make it like those audio log thingies you did vigorously for about a week and then completely forgot about. 


From,
Your Dumbass Self,
2021-01-04 Jaden
